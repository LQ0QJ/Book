Among the management topics addressed are the choices, advantages, and pitfalls of first-, second-, and third-line treatments; the European LeukemiaNet recommendations; management of adverse effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI); management of CML blast crisis; management of pregnancy in the context of CML; the role of hematopoietic cell transplantation; the current experience with TKI discontinuation; and the value of interferon α in improving the outcome of TKI treatment. Various aspects of relevance to treatment outcome are discussed, including prognostic scores, molecular monitoring (principles and interlaboratory standardization), and response-related predictors of survival. Furthermore, updates are provided on the increasing prevalence of CML and its implications and on the changing cost of care for CML, taking into account the impact of availability of generic imatinib."],"authors":[{"name":"Rüdiger Hehlmann"}],"ctr":[0.1],"custom_score":[1.2],"embeddings":[],"id":[{"dois":["10.1007/978-3-030-71913-5"],"libgen_ids":[2992275],"nexus_id":"bsinlt28ndwrmj2hl3zhk88jm"}],"issued_at":[4765132800],"languages":["en"],"links":[{"cid":"bafyb4iapvttlbirhdg2hxtx227qh6toaxgqhiauool57gzrcnu2h3pf57y","extension":"epub","filesize":11315989,"md5":"82b5082a02374cdadb03e3c4dd27c486"},{"cid":"bafyb4ihnr6t2hxwmn5yemhvbsmcxgv3d2fwjbg36ldkyufdjg7ufsfc5jq","extension":"pdf","filesize":7236478,"md5":"b91e9ae814107362e97747b3aeda1cbe","type":"primary"},{"cid":"bafykbzacecing5x433bnd26ci4w5v6ktdys4gkbnxzhk7iv4gd3jrwqrccfz2","extension":"pdf","filesize":7671269,"md5":"d2f8d24ae039ced9fe618627227e56e8"}],"metadata":[{"container_title":"Hematologic Malignancies","edition":"2","isbns":["303071912X","3030719138","9783030719128","9783030719135"],"issns":["2197-9766","2197-9774"],"publisher":"Springer"}],"navigational_facets":[],"page_rank":[0.15518588],"reference_texts":[],"referenced_by_count":[2],"references":[],"signature":[],"tags":[],"title":["Chronic Myeloid Leukemia"],"type":["book"],"updated_at":[1715864230]}}}

We examined the association between treatment with 50% versus >85% of a maximal course of adjuvant therapy (eight cycles of CAPOX, twelve cycles of FOLFOX) and mortality in stage III colon cancer. Methods: Using linked databases, we identified Ontarians aged ≥18 years at diagnosis of stage III colon cancer between 2007 and 2019. In the primary comparison, we compared patients who received 50% or >85% of a maximal course of adjuvant therapy; in a secondary comparison, we evaluated a dose effect across patients who received FOLFOX in one-cycle increments from six to ten cycles against >85% (more than ten cycles) of a maximal course of FOLFOX. The main outcomes were overall and cancer-specific mortality. Follow-up began 270 days after adjuvant treatment initiation and terminated at the first of the outcome of interest, loss of eligibility for Ontario’s Health Insurance Program, or study end. Overlap propensity score weights accounted for baseline between-group differences. We determined the hazard ratio, estimating the association between mortality and treatment. Non-inferiority was concluded in the primary comparison for either outcome if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI was ≤1.11, which is the margin used in the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy Collaboration. Results: We included 3546 patients in the analysis of overall mortality; 486 (13.7%) received 50% and 3060 (86.3%) received >85% of a maximal course of therapy. Median follow-up was 5.4 years, and total follow-up was 20,510 person-years. There were 833 deaths. Treatment with 50% of a maximal course of adjuvant therapy was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.13 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.47) for overall mortality and a subdistribution hazard ratio of 1.31 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.87) for cancer-specific mortality versus >85% of a maximal course of therapy. In the secondary comparison, there was a trend toward higher overall mortality in patients treated with shorter durations of therapy, though confidence intervals overlapped considerably. Conclusion: We could not conclude that treatment with 50% of a maximal course is non-inferior to >85% of a maximal course of adjuvant therapy for mortality in stage III colon cancer. Clinicians and patients engaging in decision-making around treatment duration in this context should carefully consider the trade-off between treatment effectiveness and adverse effects of treatment."],"authors":[{"family":"Sue-Chue-Lam","given":"Colin","sequence":"first"},{"family":"Brezden-Masley","given":"Christine","orcid":"000000024818318X","sequence":"additional"},{"family":"Sutradhar","given":"Rinku","sequence":"additional"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Amy Y.

Therefore, the remote detection of weather conditions leading to in-flight icing is a goal of great interest to the scientific community.  \nIn 2017, the Meteorological Laboratory of CIRA has developed a first satellite-based tool for in-flight icing detection in collaboration with Italian Air Force Meteorological Service. This tool is based on several high-resolution satellite products of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and a set of experimental curves and envelopes describing the interrelationship of icing-related cloud variables that represent the icing reference certification rules, namely Appendix C to FAA 14 CFR Part 25 / EASA CS-25. However, Appendix C data do not consider Supercooled Large Droplets (SLD), which have been the cause of tragic accidents over the last decades and that have been introduced in new certification procedures and guidelines through the Appendix O, effective as of 2015. In the framework of the H2020 EU project SENS4ICE (SENSors and certifiable hybrid architectures for safer aviation in ICing Environment) started in 2019, CIRA is working on a further maturation of the previously developed icing detection algorithm, in order to consider also Appendix O Icing Conditions. The developed tool is targeted to identify areas potentially affected by in flight icing hazard, giving an estimate of the altitude and of the severity of the phenomenon (light, moderate, severe) with indication of possible SLD conditions.\nIn the present work an overall description of the implemented tool is provided along with an analysis of its performance. Due to the lack of suitable in-situ observations of icing conditions, a complete validation of the developed product is challenging. A comparison with significant weather charts has been performed and other validation activities based on the comparison with soundings data are ongoing, showing quite good results. Furthermore, this tool is currently being used in the framework of the SENS4ICE flight test campaign (scheduled in April 2023), which represents a good opportunity to evaluate its performance in environmental icing conditions. During the flight tests, information on monitoring of icing conditions are provided in the pre-flight phase and updated in near-real time. The outcomes of the flight test campaign will be exploited to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm.\nAcknowledgment: This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement N° 824253 (SENS4ICE project)."],"authors":[{"family":"Zollo","given":"Alessandra Lucia","orcid":"0000000176766385","sequence":"first"},{"family":"Bucchignani","given":"Edoardo","orcid":"0000000275519240","sequence":"additional"}],"ctr":[0.1],"custom_score":[1.0],"embeddings":[],"id":[{"dois":["10.5194/ems2023-297"],"nexus_id":"cn369b16y2p5udyu56ke4n4mi"}],"issued_at":[1688601600],"languages":["en"],"links":[],"metadata":[{"publisher":"Copernicus GmbH"}],"navigational_facets":[],"page_rank":[0.15],"reference_texts":[],"referenced_by_count":[0],"references":[],"signature":[],"tags":[],"title":["An aviation support tool for satellite remote detection of in-flight icing."],"type":["posted-content"],"updated_at":[1715881820]}}}
