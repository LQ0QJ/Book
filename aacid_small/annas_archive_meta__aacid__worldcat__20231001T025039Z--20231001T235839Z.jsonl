Penguins raise their young while warding off scavenging birds, whales feed among the ice floes, seals talk underwater in songlike trills, and ice cliffs are painted with the reds and greens of tiny plants.

Others have suggested that restrictions on religion are necessary to maintain order or preserve a peaceful religious homogeneity. Brian J. Grim and Roger Finke show that restricting religious freedoms is associated with higher levels of violent persecution. Relying on a new source of coded data for nearly 200 countries and case studies of six countries, the book offers a global profile of religious freedom and religious persecution. Grim and Finke report that persecution is evident in all regions and is standard fare for many. They also find that religious freedoms are routinely denied and that government and the society at large serve to restrict these freedoms.

These coalitions provide the elite collective action underpinning strong states, robust ruling parties, cohesive militaries, and durable authoritarian regimes - all at the same time.

Although there are historical precursors and precedents of and in international criminal law,3 it was not until the 1990s, with the establishment of the ad hoc Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, that it could be said that an international criminal law regime had evolved. This is a relatively new body of law which is not yet uniform, nor are its courts universal. International criminal law developed from various sources. War crimes originate from the ?laws and customs of war?, which accord certain protections to individuals in armed conflicts. Genocide and crimes against humanity evolved to protect persons from what are now termed gross human rights abuses, including those committed by their own governments. With the probable exception of the crime of aggression with its focus on inter-State conflict, the concern of international criminal law is now with individuals and with their protection from wide-scale atrocities. As was said by the Appeal Chamber in the Tadi? case in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY): A State-sovereignty-oriented approach has been gradually supplanted by a human-being-oriented approach ? [I]nternational law, while of course duly safeguarding the legitimate interests of States, must gradually turn to the protection of human beings\"-- Provided by publisher"],"summary":"\"This market-leading textbook gives an authoritative account of international criminal law, and focuses on what the student needs to know - the crimes that are dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as the procedures that police the investigation and prosecution of those crimes.

The earliest written documents in medieval English (the visionary writings of Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe) are covered in an historical - and geographical - sweep that takes us up to the present day. The book reflects the spread of literacy, the history of colonisation and the development of post-colonial cultures using and changing the English language.
