    <p class="mb-4">
      Anna‚Äôs Archive relies on volunteers like you. We welcome all commitment levels, and have two main categories of help we‚Äôre looking for:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-inside mb-4">
      <li class="list-disc"><strong>Light volunteering work:</strong> if you can only spare a few hours here and there, there are still plenty of ways you can help out. We reward consistent volunteers with <strong>ü§ù memberships to Anna‚Äôs Archive</strong>.</li>
      <li class="list-disc"><strong>Heavy volunteering work ($50-$5,000 bounties):</strong> if you‚Äôre able to dedicate lots of time and/or resources to our mission, we‚Äôd love to work more closely with you. Eventually you can join the inner team. Though we have a tight budget, we‚Äôre able to award <strong>üí∞ monetary bounties</strong> for the most intense work.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      If you‚Äôre unable to volunteer your time, you can still help us a lot by <a href="/donate">donating money</a>, <a href="/torrents">seeding our torrents</a>, <a href="/faq#upload">uploading books</a>, or <a href="/faq#help">telling your friends about Anna‚Äôs Archive</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>Companies: </strong> we offer high-speed direct access to our collections in exchange for enterprise-level donation or exchange for new collections (e.g. new scans, OCR‚Äôed datasets, enriching our data). <a href="/contact">Contact us</a> if this is you. See also our <a href="/llm">LLM page</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 class="group mt-8 mb-1 text-xl font-bold" id="light">Light volunteering <a href="#light" class="custom-a invisible group-hover:visible text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-500 font-normal text-sm align-[2px]">¬ß</a></h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      If you have a few hours to spare, you can help out in a number of ways. Be sure to join the <a href="https://t.me/+GNQxkFPt1xkzY2Zk">volunteers chat on Telegram</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      As a token of appreciation, we typically give out 6 months of ‚ÄúLucky Librarian‚Äù for basic milestones, and more for continued volunteering work. All milestones require high quality work ‚Äî sloppy work hurts us more than it helps and we‚Äôll reject it. Please <a href="/contact">email us</a> when you reach a milestone.

      We‚Äôre always looking for people with solid programming or offensive security skills to get involved. You can make a serious dent in preserving humanity‚Äôs legacy.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      As a thank you, we give away membership for solid contributions. As a huge thank you, we give away monetary bounties for particularly important and difficult tasks. This shouldn‚Äôt be viewed as a replacement for a job, but it is an extra incentive and can help with incurred costs.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">Most of our code is open source, and we‚Äôll ask that of your code as well when awarding the bounty. There are some exceptions which we can discuss on an individual basis.</p>


    <p class="mb-4">For the larger bounties, please contact us when you‚Äôve completed ~5% of it, and you‚Äôre confident that your method will scale to the full milestone. You will have to share your method with us so we can give feedback. Also, this way we can decide what to do if there are multiple people getting close to a bounty, such as potentially awarding it to multiple people, encouraging people to team up, etc.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      WARNING: the high-bounty tasks are <strong>difficult</strong> ‚Äî it might be wise to start with easier ones.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Go to our <a href="https://software.annas-archive.se/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/issues/">Gitlab issues list</a> and sort by ‚ÄúLabel priority‚Äù. This shows roughly the order of tasks we care about. Tasks without explicit bounties are still eligible for membership, especially those marked ‚ÄúAccepted‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnna‚Äôs favorite‚Äù. You might want to start with a ‚ÄúStarter project‚Äù.
