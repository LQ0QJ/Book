    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-1 text-3xl font-bold">LLM data</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      It is well understood that LLMs thrive on high-quality data. We have the largest collection of books, papers, magazines, etc in the world, which are some of the highest quality text sources.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-1 text-xl font-bold">Unique scale and range</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
      Our collection contains over a hundred million files, including academic journals, textbooks, and magazines. We achieve this scale by combining large existing repositories.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Some of our source collections are already available in bulk (Sci-Hub, and parts of Libgen). Other sources we liberated ourselves. <a href="/datasets">Datasets</a> shows a full overview.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Our collection includes millions of books, papers, and magazines from before the e-book era. Large parts of this collection have already been OCR’ed, and already have little internal overlap.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4 mb-1 text-xl font-bold">How we can help</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      We’re able to provide high-speed access to our full collections, as well as to unreleased collections.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      This is enterprise-level access that we can provide for donations in the range of tens of thousands USD. We’re also willing to trade this for high-quality collections that we don’t have yet.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      We can refund you if you’re able to provide us with enrichment of our data, such as:
