    <p><strong>Progress bar</strong></p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      The progress bar on the home page is currently not meaningful.
      We don't know how many unique editions we actually have in shadow libraries (vs how many duplicates), nor do we know <a href="http://annas-blog.org/blog-isbndb-dump-how-many-books-are-preserved-forever.html">how many books</a> there are in the world.
      And humanity’s written heritage extends beyond just books — especially nowadays.
      But we aspire to figure out those numbers, as well as expand beyond books.
      Hopefully we can fill in this progress bar with real data in the future.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      For now, the progress bar highlights our ambition and philosophy. We hope to inspire you to join us on this mission.
