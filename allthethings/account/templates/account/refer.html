  <h2 class="mt-4 mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">Refer friends to get bonus downloads</h2>

  <p class="mb-1">
    Members can refer friends and earn bonus downloads. For every friend who becomes a member:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-inside mb-4 ml-1">
    <li class="list-disc"><strong>They</strong> get 50% bonus downloads on top of regular daily downloads, for the duration of their membership.</li>
    <li class="list-disc"><strong>You</strong> get the same number of bonus downloads on top of your regular daily downloads, for the same duration as your friend signed up for (up to a total of {{ MEMBERSHIP_MAX_BONUS_DOWNLOADS | numberformat }} total bonus downloads at any given time). You need to maintain an active membership to use your bonus downloads.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-1">
    Example:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-inside mb-4 ml-1">
    <li class="list-disc">Your friend uses your referral link to sign up for 3 months “Lucky Librarian” membership, which comes with 50 fast downloads.</li>
    <li class="list-disc">They receive 25 bonus downloads every day, for all of those 3 months.</li>
    <li class="list-disc">You also receive 25 bonus downloads every day, for the same 3 months.</li>
  </ul>
