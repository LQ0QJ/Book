    Hi, I’m Anna. I created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive">Anna’s Archive</a>, to make shadow libraries more searchable and usable. Before that, I started the Pirate Library Mirror, aimed at preserving important collections. This is my personal blog, in which I and my teammates write about piracy, digital preservation, and more.
