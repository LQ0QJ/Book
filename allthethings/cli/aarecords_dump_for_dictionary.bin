The first edition was winner of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (IACP) Cookbook Award. Its carefully researched information and fully tested recipes span the international spectrum of the modern garde manger station. Four sections covering twenty chapters focus on the chef's required knowledge and responsibilities. This second edition has been reorganized to provide a clearer transition from subject to subject, and skill set to skill set. Special features include: Chapter Goals; Professional Profiles; Ask the Expert; People, Places, Things; Review Questions; Activities and Applications; and Key Words in Review. The text contains material on molecular cuisine, plus creative equipment used by garde manger chefs. There are more than 800 four-color photographs of which more than 300 are new, including many finished plates, platters, showpieces and step-by-step procedures, plus many additional recipes and expanded content on food show competition, buffet table layouts, ice sculpting techniques and more. . While Modern Garde Manger, 2e still retains its exposure to international recipes and techniques, more traditionally American recipes and techniques have been included in this edition. MODERN GARDE MANGER 2E is the most comprehensive book of its kind available for today's student and professional chef. In addition, a CourseMate website is available to accompany the text. CourseMate includes: an interactive eBook; Engagement Tracker, a first-of-its-kind tool that monitors student engagement in the course; and interactive teaching and learning tools including quizzes, flashcards, crossword puzzles, PowerPoint slides and more.<br><b>Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version. </b></br>","language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"2002","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":["9780000000026"],"search_doi":[],"search_text":"Successful Slimming: Cassette\\nNelson, Bob, Ph.D.\\n2002, 1\\nNelson Motivation Inc.\\n\\nisbn:9780000000026\\n\\nSlimming Ph D Inc isbn 9780000000026\\n\\n\\nisbn10:0000000027 0000000027\\nisbn13:9780000000026 9780000000026\\nisbn:9780000000026","search_access_types":["meta_explore"],"search_record_sources":["isbndb"],"search_bulk_torrents":"no_bulk_torrents","search_score_base":10031.0,"search_score_base_rank":10031.0}}

Especially emphasized is the period since 1917 when the U.S. acquired the Islands from Denmark. Constituting three small Caribbean islands, St. Thomas, St. Croix and St. John, each is unique, but together they are widely known as a favorite tourist destination featuring sun, sand and surf. In many respects, the territory is a microcosm of the human family. The diversity of its physical environment is matched by the diversity of its people. The focal point of the book is a record of the struggle of the Islanders' greater number as slaves, then serfs, and lastly as citizens to gain control of their own destiny. This is a history of human rights and human wrongs. The author does not merely portray the history of the Islands and their people; he also shows how the Islanders share the same aspirations as other colonial subjects. In so doing he taps previously unused sources. The relationship between the United States and the Virgin Islands has been marked by indifference and vacillation on the part of American officials. Moreover, the thousands of tourists who flock to the territory annually are unaware of the Islands' checkered and rich history. For many, the Islands are simply a tropical paradise. This work is an extensively documented, and detailed source of information, valuable to those interested in a political and cultural perspective, to those interested in African American or Caribbean history, and likewise to those who live in or visit the Islands","language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"1965","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":[],"search_doi":[],"search_text":"Smithsonian Institution (National Museum act of 1965) : Hearing before the Subcommittee on The Smithsonian Institution of the Committee on Rules and Administration, United States Senate, Eighty-ninth Congress, first session, on S. 1310 and H.R. 7315, bills relating to the National Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, June 24, 1965\\nUnited States\\nWashington, D.C, 1965\\nUnited States Government Printing Office\\n\\noclc:38\\n\\nS H R D C, oclc 38\\n\\n\\noclc:38 38\\noclc:38","search_access_types":["meta_explore"],"search_record_sources":["oclc"],"search_bulk_torrents":"no_bulk_torrents","search_score_base":10026.0,"search_score_base_rank":10026.0}}

In this important book, leadership expert Richard Daft portrays this dilemma as a struggle between instinct (elephant) and intention (the executive) using the most current research on the intentional vs. the habitual mind to explain how this phenomenon occurs.

His much awaited memoir is filled with insights about the successes and failures from his long and storied life and career. Bennis' life and career have traversed eight decades of first-hand experience with tumultuous episodes of recent history-from Jewish child in a gentile town in the 30's, a young army recruit in the Battle of the Bulge to a college student in the one of the first progressive precursors to the civil rights movement to a patient undergoing daily psychoanalysis for five years, and later a university provost during the Vietnam protests. Reveals the triumphs and struggles of the man who is considered the pioneer in the contemporary field of leadership studies Bennis is the author of 27 books including the bestseller On Becoming a Leader.

Under an all-powerful oil cartel, the energy market had long eluded the grasp of America's hungry capitalists, but the rough-and-tumble traders of Nymex went after this Goliath and won, creating the world's first free oil market.

Penguins raise their young while warding off scavenging birds, whales feed among the ice floes, seals talk underwater in songlike trills, and ice cliffs are painted with the reds and greens of tiny plants. Bruce McMillan, known for his lively and informative nature books, traveled to the Antarctic Peninsula to capture that surprisingly vigorous environment on film.

Relying on a new source of coded data for nearly 200 countries and case studies of six countries, the book offers a global profile of religious freedom and religious persecution. Grim and Finke report that persecution is evident in all regions and is standard fare for many. They also find that religious freedoms are routinely denied and that government and the society at large serve to restrict these freedoms.

Although there are historical precursors and precedents of and in international criminal law,3 it was not until the 1990s, with the establishment of the ad hoc Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, that it could be said that an international criminal law regime had evolved. This is a relatively new body of law which is not yet uniform, nor are its courts universal. International criminal law developed from various sources. War crimes originate from the ?laws and customs of war?, which accord certain protections to individuals in armed conflicts. Genocide and crimes against humanity evolved to protect persons from what are now termed gross human rights abuses, including those committed by their own governments. With the probable exception of the crime of aggression with its focus on inter-State conflict, the concern of international criminal law is now with individuals and with their protection from wide-scale atrocities. As was said by the Appeal Chamber in the Tadi? case in the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY): A State-sovereignty-oriented approach has been gradually supplanted by a human-being-oriented approach ? [I]nternational law, while of course duly safeguarding the legitimate interests of States, must gradually turn to the protection of human beings\\"-- Provided by publisher","stripped_description_additional":["\\"This market-leading textbook gives an authoritative account of international criminal law, and focuses on what the student needs to know - the crimes that are dealt with by international courts and tribunals as well as the procedures that police the investigation and prosecution of those crimes. The reader is guided through controversies with an accessible, yet sophisticated approach by the author team of four international lawyers, with experience both of teaching the subject, and as negotiators at the foundation of the International Criminal Court and the Rome conference. It is an invaluable introduction for all students of international criminal law and international relations, and now covers developments in the ICC, victims' rights, and alternatives to international criminal justice, as well as including extended coverage of terrorism.

In addition to showcasing traditional facts of national leadership and state power, the Encyclopedia embraces social and cultural developments, non-European history, women's history, religion, health, economics, technology, and other vital but less often reported aspects of the human drama. Here is a chronicle not only of major political events but of ordinary people, covering shifts in the relationships between men and women, developments in leisure, and demographic currents. And for all periods there are summaries of global developments that cannot be captured in national or regional frameworks. As editor Stearns notes in his preface, \\"The world we know historically has greatly changed.

Niépce died suddenly in 1833, but Daguerre continued experimenting and evolved the process which would subsequently be known as the Daguerreotype. It has recently been discovered that Daguerre may have mislead Niepce's son about the value of the invention in order to better claim any profits from it individually. After efforts to interest private investors proved fruitless, Daguerre went public with his invention in 1839. At a meeting of the French Academy of Sciences on 7 January of that year, the invention was announced and described in general terms, but all specific details were withheld. Under assurances of strict confidentiality, Daguerre explained and demonstrated the process only to the Academy's perpetual secretary François Arago, who proved to be an invaluable advocate. Members of the Academy and other select individuals were allowed to examine specimens at Daguerre's studio. The images were enthusiastically praised as nearly miraculous and news of the Daguerreotype quickly spread. Arrangements were made for Daguerre's rights to be acquired by the French Government in exchange for lifetime pensions for himself and Niépce's son Isidore; then, on 19 August 1839, the French Government presented the invention as a gift from France \\"free to the world\\" and complete working instructions were published","language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"1968","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":["9780486222905"],"search_doi":[],"search_text":"L.J.M.

Many of the problems arise from the failure in the separate disciplines to understand the basis on which collaboration is necessary and possible. In an effort to shed light on the situation, these original essays by eminent scholars - economists, geographers, psychologists, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists, and others - demonstrate effective means of achieving interdisciplinary coordination in studying human behavior and delineating promising areas - for cooperative research. The book provides a sophisticated guide to the nature of knowledge in social science as applied to its core disciplines. Since the social sciences separately are studying and theorizing about many of the same kinds of human behavior, the contributors propose that scholars can avoid possible duplication of effort and increase the validity of their formulations by consulting the related findings and methodology from other disciplines before embarking on a research problem. The contributors maintain that this interchange, by broadening the total knowledge of each discipline, represents the best approach toward fulfilling the goals of social scientific inquiry. The individual chapters give valuable insight into the theoretical overlaps among the disciplines and outline specific research areas - such as group interaction, political attitudes, and intergroup relations - that require interdisciplinary cooperation to produce valid formulations. A major step toward creating a dialogue among disciplines, the book will enable every social scientist to understand more clearly the current state and future direction of interdisciplinary relationships and their indispensable future in social scientific thought","language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"1969","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":[],"search_doi":[],"search_text":"Interdisciplinary relationships in the social sciences\\nMuzafer Sherif; Carolyn W Sherif\\nChicago, 1969\\nAldine\\n\\noclc:529\\n\\noclc 529\\n\\n\\noclc:529 529\\noclc:529","search_access_types":["meta_explore"],"search_record_sources":["oclc"],"search_bulk_torrents":"no_bulk_torrents","search_score_base":10026.0,"search_score_base_rank":10026.0}}

Through stories of patients and doctors, political prisoners and bureaucrats, the young and the old, it probes the fears and the hopes of an entire cross-section of Soviet society. Cancer ward has been seen as a metaphor for the malignancy afflicting the Russian nation, but the moral and ethical questions it raises-about love and conscience, life and death, spiritual sorrows and triumphs-rise above their immediate political context to assure universal significance. This is the complete unexpurgated edition translated by Nicholas Betthell and David Burg. It includes Solzhenitsyn's world-famous letters to the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers and the Writers' Union, a transcript of the proceedings of the session of the Soviet Writers' Secretariat, and an afterword by Vladimir Petrov. During February and March of 1955, several men pass through the men's cancer ward in a Soviet hospital","language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"1969","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":[],"search_doi":[],"search_text":"Cancer ward\\nAleksandr Isaevich Solzhenit︠s︡yn\\nNew York, 1969\\nFarrar, Straus and Giroux\\n\\noclc:625\\n\\noclc 625\\n\\n\\noclc:625 625\\noclc:625","search_access_types":["meta_explore"],"search_record_sources":["oclc"],"search_bulk_torrents":"no_bulk_torrents","search_score_base":10026.0,"search_score_base_rank":10026.0}}

His pronouncements were the sounding board of an intellectual renaissance in America. His celebrated address \\"The American Scholar\\" was hailed by Oliver Wendell Holmes as \\"our intellectual Declaration of Independence.\\" From his copious \\"Journals,\\" which recorded the experiences, thoughts, and feelings of a lifetime, Emerson drew the material for his lectures and writings. His works rank among the most eloquent examples of New England transcendentalist thought. He is a giant among giants- his friends and acquaintances included Thoreau, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Bronson Alcott, Margaret Fuller, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. By his own example and by his influence on his talented contemporaries, he advanced American literature and thought as perhaps no other man has. Carl Bode has brought together a selection of biographical and interpretive essays that show Emerson the man, as he was viewed by his contemporaries and as he looks today. The result is a composite, revealing picture of one of the most illustrious characters in nineteenth-century America\\"--Jacket","stripped_description_additional":["Essays to help you understand and appreciate the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson"],"language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"1969","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":[],"search_doi":[],"search_text":"Ralph Waldo Emerson : a profile\\nCarl Bode\\nAmerican profiles (New York, N.Y.), New York, 1969\\nHill and Wang\\n\\noclc:694\\n\\nN Y ), oclc 694\\n\\n\\noclc:694 694\\noclc:694","search_access_types":["meta_explore"],"search_record_sources":["oclc"],"search_bulk_torrents":"no_bulk_torrents","search_score_base":10026.0,"search_score_base_rank":10026.0}}

Wallace has up to now been neglected by the historians of that period. The Schapsmeier brothers have filled that gap with this thorough examination of the origins and development of the Wallace political philosophy. By tracing and analyzing Wallace's evolving thought in the context of contemporary events, they depict his genius in the varied roles of scientist, economist, farm editor, and original thinker in agricultural policy. Special emphasis is placed on his relationship with Franklin D. Roosevelt and his contributions to the Roosevelt administration as Secretary of Agriculture, administrator of the vast farm programs, spokesman for rural America, and philosopher for New Deal programs. While the main focus of the book is on Henry A. Wallace, the authors also cast light on several other areas. They reveal the importance of Henry C. Wallace as a Progressive leader in the era of Harding and Coolidge; present new insights into the importance of the McNary-Haugen movement in the formulation of agricultural policy for the agrarian sector; and evaluate the influence of Populism and Progressivism in the New Deal farm coalition. In addition, they assess the role of agricultural economists as architects of specific farm legislation. Historians will find this a comprehensive, significant, and worthwhile study of one of the great figures in agricultural history.\\"--Jacket","language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"1968","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":["9780813817415"],"search_doi":[],"search_text":"Henry A.

Only the writings of the Shelleys themselves surpass hers in importance for those interested in the careers of the poets and their friends. Best known as Byron's mistress and the mother of his daughter Allegra, \\"Claire,\\" as she preferred to be called, is important to literary history for her role in bringing Byron and Shelley together. Claire Clairmont began her journals in 1814, when she accompanied Shelley and her half-sister, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, on their elopement to the continent. She continued to write them until after Byron and Shelley were dead and she was living as a governess with a wealthy family in Moscow. The journals present a detailed and fascinating picture of life with the Shelley family their discovery of the European landscape, wretched days in London dodging bailiffs and bill collectors, happy days of opera and ballet and endless conversations. Our knowledge of the Shelleys' life in Italy is expanded by this intimate view of the brilliant society of artists, writers, musicians, actors, scholars, revolutionaries, and nobility who were their constant companions. The later entries provide an account of the daily life of an Englishwoman living in Russia during the exciting time of the Decembrist uprising. In The Journals of Claire Clairemont, Stocking has brought together five of Claire's journals, all that is known of the now-lost Russian journal, and two leaflets of Miscellanea dealing with the years 1828 to 1830. The interruptions in the diaries are bridged by narratives that allow the reader to follow her life, as she develops from an effervescent schoolgirl into a self-possessed, attractive, and talented young woman. Appendices present reviews of theatrical performances seen by Claire and the Shelleys, biographical sketches of the varied personages they knew in Italy, a review by Mary Shelley (1826) describing people and life on the Continent as Claire and the Shelleys saw it, and the text of a manuscript fragment, possibly by Claire, containing thinly disguised romantic portrayals of the Shelleys and Jane and Edward Ellerker Williams. There is also a list of Claire's voluminous and systematic reading. Editorial comment within the body of the text has been kept to a minimum, and all of Claire's rewritings and crossings out are clearly indicated. Genealogical tables and numerous footnotes help to place Claire's journals in their proper social and historical perspective","language_codes":["en"],"most_likely_language_code":"en","classifications_unified":{},"problems":[],"content_type":"book_unknown","has_aa_downloads":0,"has_aa_exclusive_downloads":0,"has_torrent_paths":0},"indexes":["aarecords_metadata"],"ipfs_infos":[],"search_only_fields":{"search_filesize":0,"search_year":"1968","search_extension":"","search_content_type":"book_unknown","search_most_likely_language_code":"en","search_isbn13":[],"search_doi":["10.4159/harvard.9780674430440"],"search_text":"The journals of Claire Clairmont\\nClaire Clairmont; Marion Kingston Stocking; David M Stocking; Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley; Harvard University.

Half-demons don't belong in angel territory. But I'm kind of an expert at staying hidden and running my quiet magical business from my sister's cafe. So, imagine my surprise when an archangel tracks me down and offers me a new job. He insists that someone's attacking archangel students at a prestigious college, and no one -- not even the best investigators -- can crack the case. Why does this man think I can? Who the hell knows. I'm a tracker for lost items. I'm not a crime investigator. Besides, who cares if the snotty, rich archangels are in danger? I certainly shouldn't. But everything in me is pushing me to take this job. Urging to follow this gorgeous, lethal man into the shadows to find a killer. All I have to do is go undercover at the school and find the culprit before the month is over. If I fail, someone else dies.
